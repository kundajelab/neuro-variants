# Analysis

These sets of scripts in the **`analysis/`** directory generate all of the results presented in the manuscript.

---

## 1_ChromBPNet_PreprocessingAnalysis

These scripts process **chromBPNet** variant scoring outputs and compile annotation tables for downstream analyses.

### Steps:
1. **Extract outputs**: Run `1_pull_scores.sh` to extract relevant ChromBPNet outputs.
2. **Analyze model performance**:  
   - `2a_model_performance.R` evaluates performance metrics.  
   - `2b_model_performance_plot.R` identifies model outliers.
3. **Annotate variants**:  
   - Use `3a_bed2vcf.Rare.CADD_VEP.R` or `3b_bed2vcf.ASD.CADD_VEP.R` to run **CADD** and **VEP**.
   - Process outputs with `3c_Process_CADD_VEP.R`.
4. **Merge results**: Run `4_mergeData.R` to integrate annotations, merge scores, and remove outliers.

## 2_Effects_Across_Contexts

These scripts correspond to the manuscript section **"Variants effects are shaped by genomic context and TF binding"**.  
They analyze:
- **Genomic context** â€“ A variantâ€™s proximity to transcribed regions.
- **Cell-type specificity** â€“ How constrained or widespread variant effects are.
- **Regulatory magnitude** â€“ The extent of chromatin accessibility and TF binding changes.

## 3_Application_to_GWAS_and_QTL_studies

These scripts support the manuscript sections:
- **"Context-specific models reveal regulatory effects of fine-mapped eQTLs"**
- **"Pinpointing disease-relevant variants using cell-type-specific chromatin models"**
- **"Microglia-driven mechanisms of Alzheimerâ€™s disease risk"**

We use **chromBPnet-predicted regulatory effects** to identify candidate causal variants affecting gene regulation and disease risk.

---

## 4_Rare_vs_Common

These scripts correspond to:
- **"Ultra-rare variants show larger and more shared regulatory effects than common variants"**
- **"Fetal neurons shape selective constraint in non-coding regions"**

They compare rare and common variant effects to understand the selective pressures that influence allele frequency distributions across human populations.

## 5_FLARE

These scripts correspond to:
- **"FLARE: a functional genomic model of constraint"**
- **"FLARE prioritizes de novo non-coding mutations in autism"**

Since **PhyloP** scores are not context-specific, **FLARE** models the relationship between genomic context, regulatory effects, and evolutionary conservation within **cell-type-specific contexts**. FLARE:
1. **Disentangles** accessibility and regulatory effects from conservation.
2. **Integrates** multiple functional genomic features into a unified model.
3. **Captures** regulatory potential across multiple cell types.

[We set up a FLARE repository for the FLARE method, which can be found by clicking here.](https://github.com/drewmard/FLARE)
